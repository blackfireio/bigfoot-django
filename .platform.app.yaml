# in multiple versions. Check the Python documentation
# (https://docs.platform.sh/languages/python.html#supported-versions)
# to find the supported versions for the 'python' type.

# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.

# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand

# The following block defines a single writable directory, 'web/uploads'
# The 'source' specifies where the writable mount is. The 'local' source
